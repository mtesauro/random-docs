## Arachni

### Description

"The highlights of this release are:

* Simplified Issue structures in the generated reports.
* Support for populating the browsers' localStorage from a JSON file.
* Support for auditing UI Inputs -- orphaned <input> elements, submitting their data
    via callbacks for DOM events.
* Support for auditing UI Forms -- <input> and <button> groups not belonging to any
    <form> elements, but instead associated via JavaScript code.
* Performance improvements resulting in significantly reduced scan durations."

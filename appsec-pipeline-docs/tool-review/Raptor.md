## Raptor

### Description

Raptor is a web-based (web-serivce + UI) github centric source-vulnerability scanner i.e. it scans a repository with just the github repo url. You can setup webhooks to ensure automated scans everytime you commit or merge a pull request. The scan is done asynchonously and the results are available only to the user who initiated the scan.
